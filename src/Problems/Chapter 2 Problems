Chapter 2: Linked Lists

2.1 Remove Dups
Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.

How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

2.2 Return Kth to Last
Implement an algorithm to kind the kth to last element of a single linked list.

2.3 Delete Middle Node
Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but the first and last node,
not necessarily in the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

EXAMPLE
Input: the node c from the linked list a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a -> b -> d -> e -> f
